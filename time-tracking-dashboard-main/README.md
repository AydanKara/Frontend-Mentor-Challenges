## My process

### 🛠️ Built With
- Semantic HTML5 for structured content
- CSS3 with Flexbox & Grid for responsive layout
- JavaScript (ES6+) for dynamic interactions
- Fetch API to load and display JSON data
- CSS Variables for maintainable theming
- Accessibility best practices to improve usability

### 📚 What I learned

This project reinforced key frontend concepts, including:

- Improving Accessibility & Semantic Structure
  - Used semantic HTML elements (article, section, h2-h6 headings) for better screen reader navigation.
- Fetching and Rendering Dynamic Data
  - Learned how to load data from a JSON file asynchronously and update UI dynamically.

### 🔄 Continued Development
Future improvements for this project:

✅ Improve Mobile UX: Refining touch interactions and optimize responsiveness.

✅ Add Animations: Using GSAP or Framer Motion for smooth transitions.

✅ Improve Accessibility: Adding more ARIA roles and keyboard navigation support.

✅ Dark Mode Support: Implementing a theme switcher for better UX.
