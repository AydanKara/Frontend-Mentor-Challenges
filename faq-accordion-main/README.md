# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion

![Design preview for the FAQ accordion coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this FAQ accordion and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to: 

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## Where to find everything

The task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder.

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The images are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information, such as color palette and fonts.
