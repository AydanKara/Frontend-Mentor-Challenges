## ⚙️ My Process

### 🏗️ Built With

- ✅ Semantic HTML5
- ✅ CSS custom properties
- ✅ Flexbox & CSS Grid
- ✅ JavaScript (ES6+)
- ✅ Mobile-first workflow

### 🧠 What I Learned

This project reinforced several important concepts, including:

🔹 The importance of **CSS modularization** – initially, my CSS grew too large, so i refactored it into **smaller reusable styles**.
🔹 How to implement **ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation** to improve **accessibility**.
🔹 Using **CSS Grid and Flexbox** together for a **fully responsive layout**.
🔹 Handling **mobile navigation** efficiently with **JavaScript event listeners**.

### 🔄 Continued Development

🚀 Future improvements:

🔹 **CSS Refactoring** – Explore **SCSS** for better organization.
🔹 **JavaScript Enhancements** – Consider a framework (e.g., **React**) for complex UI elements.

### 📚 Useful Resources
